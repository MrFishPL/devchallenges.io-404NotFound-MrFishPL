  Sorry but I realy don't know writing "demo" :P The project is [here](https://www.figma.com/file/QeKWLNhB13zDjJzqR22TKE)
- What was your experience?
  It wasn't very hard. I had a lot of fun doing this challenge. The layout was interesting and the colors and the image were really pleasing to the eye.
- What have you learned/improved?
  I've improved my flexbox and doing responsive website skills (the layout was very simple but interesting).
- Your wisdom? :)
  I wanna do other challenges because now I'm very excited and motivated :D
